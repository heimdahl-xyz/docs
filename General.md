## General Information

A blockchain event indexer is a tool or service designed to listen for specific events occurring on one or multiple blockchains, capture these events, and store them in a structured format for easy querying and analysis. These events can include smart contract executions, token transfers, or any custom events defined in smart contracts. By maintaining an up-to-date index of blockchain events, developers and analysts can gain real-time insights and create applications that respond to blockchain activity.

Typical use cases include tracking DeFi activities, monitoring NFT transfers, and building dashboards for transaction analytics.

### Overview

The blockchain event indexer simplifies the process of accessing and querying on-chain data by providing a structured database of blockchain events. It listens to various event logs emitted by smart contracts, processes and normalizes this data, and makes it available through APIs or a query interface. This ensures that developers can build responsive, data-driven applications without directly interacting with the blockchain, improving efficiency and reducing the complexity of working with raw on-chain data.

#### Typical Components:

**Event Listener:** Captures events from multiple blockchains.

**Data Processor:** Normalizes and enriches data for analysis.

**Indexer Database:** Stores structured event data.

**Query Interface:** Enables efficient querying through APIs or custom UIs.
